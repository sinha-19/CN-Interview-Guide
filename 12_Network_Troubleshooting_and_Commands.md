# 12. Network Troubleshooting & Commands

---

## Why is Network Troubleshooting Important?

Network troubleshooting is the process of identifying, diagnosing, and resolving problems in a network to ensure smooth and efficient communication between devices.

---

## Common Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Identify the Problem:** Gather information about symptoms (slow speed, no connectivity, etc.).
2. **Establish a Theory:** Consider possible causes (hardware, configuration, ISP issues, etc.).
3. **Test the Theory:** Use tools and commands to check network status.
4. **Establish an Action Plan:** Decide how to fix the issue.
5. **Implement the Solution:** Apply fixes (replace cables, change configs, etc.).
6. **Verify Full System Functionality:** Make sure the problem is resolved.
7. **Document the Solution:** Keep records for future reference.

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue                    | Possible Causes              | Solution                        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| No Internet              | Cable unplugged, ISP down   | Check cables, restart modem      |
| Slow Network             | Bandwidth hog, interference | Limit usage, change Wi-Fi channel|
| IP Conflict              | Duplicate IPs assigned      | Set static IPs, check DHCP       |
| DNS Not Resolving        | Wrong DNS config            | Change to public DNS (8.8.8.8)   |
| Can‚Äôt Connect to Device  | Firewall, wrong IP/subnet   | Check firewall, verify IP config |

## Basic Troubleshooting Flowchart

1. **Check Physical Layer:** Cables, LEDs, power.
2. **Check IP Configuration:** Use `ipconfig`/`ifconfig`.
3. **Check Connectivity:** Use `ping`.
4. **Check Routing:** `traceroute`/`tracert`.
5. **Check DNS:** Use `nslookup`.
6. **Check for Open Ports:** Use `netstat`, `nmap`.
