# 03. Physical Layer

## What is the Physical Layer?

The **Physical Layer** is the first and lowest layer in the OSI model. It deals with the physical connection between devices and the transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium.

---

## Main Functions of the Physical Layer

- **Bit Transmission:** Converts data to electrical, optical, or radio signals for transmission.
- **Data Rate Control:** Manages the speed (bits per second) of data transmission.
- **Physical Topology:** Defines how devices are physically connected (star, bus, ring, etc.).
- **Transmission Mode:** Specifies direction of data flow (Simplex, Half Duplex, Full Duplex).
- **Synchronization of Bits:** Ensures sender and receiver are synchronized at bit level.
- **Physical Medium Interface:** Specifies characteristics of transmission media (cables, connectors, etc.).

## Types of Transmission Media

### 1. Guided Media (Wired)

| Type          | Description                        | Example Uses         |
|---------------|------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Twisted Pair  | Two insulated copper wires twisted | LAN, telephone lines |
| Coaxial Cable | Central conductor, shielded        | Cable TV, Ethernet   |
| Fiber Optic   | Light pulses through glass fibers  | High-speed networks  |

### 2. Unguided Media (Wireless)

| Type        | Description                          | Example Uses           |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Radio Waves | Wireless signals via radio spectrum  | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM   |
| Microwaves  | High-frequency radio waves           | Satellite, cellular    |
| Infrared    | Line-of-sight, short distance        | Remote controls, IRDA  |

---

## Transmission Modes

- **Simplex:** One-way communication only (e.g., keyboard to CPU).
- **Half Duplex:** Both directions, but one at a time (e.g., walkie-talkie).
- **Full Duplex:** Both directions simultaneously (e.g., telephone).

---

## Devices Operating at Physical Layer

- Hubs
- Repeaters
- Modems
- Cables and connectors

---

## Key Terms

- **Bandwidth:** Maximum data transfer rate of a medium.
- **Attenuation:** Loss of signal strength over distance.
- **Noise:** Unwanted signals causing errors.
- **Throughput:** Actual rate of successful data transfer.

| Term         | Meaning                           |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Simplex      | One-way data flow                 |
| Half Duplex  | Two-way, but one at a time        |
| Full Duplex  | Two-way, simultaneous             |
| Bandwidth    | Max data rate of a channel        |
| Attenuation  | Signal loss over distance         |
