# 01. Introduction to Computer Networks

## What is a Computer Network?

A **computer network** is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, routers, etc.) that communicate and share resources (data, files, applications, and hardware like printers) with each other.

---

## Why are Networks Important?

- **Resource Sharing:** Share files, printers, and internet connections efficiently.
- **Communication:** Enables emails, messaging, video calls, and collaboration tools.
- **Cost Reduction:** Centralized data storage and management reduce costs.
- **Scalability:** Add new devices or users easily as organizations grow.

## Types of Computer Networks

| Type              | Coverage Area            | Example                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **PAN**           | Personal (meters)       | Bluetooth between phone & headphones    |
| **LAN**           | Local (building/campus) | Office/home network, school lab         |
| **MAN**           | City/Metro              | City-wide Wi-Fi, cable TV network       |
| **WAN**           | Country/World           | The Internet, multinational company LANs|

## Components of a Network

- **End Devices:** PCs, laptops, servers, phones
- **Networking Devices:** Switches, routers, hubs, modems
- **Transmission Media:** Cables (UTP, fiber), wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)
- **Protocols:** Rules for communication (TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, etc.)

---

## Network Topologies

- **Bus:** Single central cable, simple but not scalable
- **Star:** Devices connect to a central device (switch/hub)
- **Ring:** Each device connected to two others, forming a ring
- **Mesh:** Every device connects to every other (robust but expensive)
- **Hybrid:** Combination of two or more topologies

---

## Uses of Computer Networks

- Internet access and web browsing
- Email and instant messaging
- File sharing and remote access
- Online gaming and media streaming
- Cloud computing

---

## Real-World Analogy

Think of a computer network like a postal system â€” each device is a house, connected by roads (cables or Wi-Fi), using a standard addressing system (IP addresses), and mail (data) is sent using rules everyone understands (protocols).
