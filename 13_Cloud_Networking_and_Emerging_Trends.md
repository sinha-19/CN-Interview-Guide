# 13. Cloud Networking & Emerging Trends

---

## What is Cloud Networking?

**Cloud Networking** refers to using cloud-based resources and services to manage, monitor, and deliver network functions, infrastructure, and security.

---

## Key Characteristics

- **On-demand scalability:** Instantly scale resources up/down.
- **Pay-as-you-go:** Only pay for resources used.
- **Centralized management:** Manage network resources from anywhere.
- **Elasticity:** Adapt to workload changes automatically.

## Common Cloud Network Services

| Service Type             | Description                                   | Example Providers        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) | Virtualized hardware resources (VMs, storage, networking) | AWS EC2, Azure VM, GCP Compute Engine |
| PaaS (Platform as a Service)       | Platforms for app development/deployment          | AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service |
| SaaS (Software as a Service)       | Hosted software applications                     | Google Workspace, Office 365            |
| Cloud VPN/Direct Connect           | Secure private connections to cloud              | AWS VPN/Direct Connect, Azure VPN        |
| Cloud Load Balancer                | Distributes network traffic across resources     | AWS ELB, Azure Load Balancer             |
| CDN (Content Delivery Network)     | Delivers content globally with low latency       | Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS CloudFront        |
| SDN (Software Defined Networking)  | Programmable, automated network control          | VMware NSX, Cisco ACI                    |
| SASE (Secure Access Service Edge)  | Combined network and security as a cloud service | Zscaler, Netskope                        |

## Emerging Trends in Networking

- **Software Defined Networking (SDN):** Decouples control and data planes for programmatic management.
- **Network Function Virtualization (NFV):** Runs network functions as virtualized services (firewalls, load balancers).
- **Edge Computing:** Processes data closer to users/devices for low latency.
- **5G Networks:** High speed, massive device connectivity, low latency.
- **Zero Trust Security:** Never trust, always verify‚Äîstrict access controls everywhere.
- **AI/ML in Networking:** Automated monitoring, anomaly detection, and threat prevention.
- **Internet of Things (IoT):** Billions of devices connected and networked.

## Security in Cloud Networking

- **Shared Responsibility Model:** Cloud provider secures infrastructure; user secures data/applications.
- **Encryption:** Data should be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Strict user and service access controls.
- **Network Segmentation:** Isolate sensitive resources using VPCs/subnets.
