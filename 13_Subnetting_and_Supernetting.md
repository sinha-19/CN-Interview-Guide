# 12. Subnetting & Supernetting

## What is Subnetting?

**Subnetting** is the process of dividing a larger network (IP address block) into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets). This helps in efficient IP address utilization, improved network performance, and enhanced security.

---

### Why Subnet?

- **Efficient IP address management**
- **Improved network performance** (reduces broadcast traffic)
- **Enhanced security** (segmentation)
- **Simplifies troubleshooting**

---

## Subnet Masks

- A **subnet mask** separates the network and host portions of an IP address.
- Common subnet masks:
  - Class A: 255.0.0.0 (/8)
  - Class B: 255.255.0.0 (/16)
  - Class C: 255.255.255.0 (/24)

---

## CIDR Notation

- CIDR = Classless Inter-Domain Routing
- Expresses subnet masks as a ‚Äúslash‚Äù followed by the number of network bits.
  - Example: 192.168.1.0/24 means the first 24 bits are the network part.

---

## How to Subnet

1. **Decide the number of subnets or hosts needed.**
2. **Determine the number of bits to borrow from the host portion** (to create more subnets).
3. **Calculate new subnet mask and address ranges.**
4. **Assign subnets to network segments/devices.**

---

### Example

- Given: 192.168.1.0/24, need 4 subnets.
- 2 bits needed (2¬≤ = 4 subnets).
- New mask: /26 (255.255.255.192)
- Subnet ranges:
  - 192.168.1.0/26 (hosts: .1 - .62)
  - 192.168.1.64/26 (hosts: .65 - .126)
  - 192.168.1.128/26 (hosts: .129 - .190)
  - 192.168.1.192/26 (hosts: .193 - .254)

## What is Supernetting?

**Supernetting** is the process of combining multiple contiguous smaller networks into a larger one. It is used mainly in route aggregation to reduce the size of routing tables.

- Also known as route summarization or aggregation.
- Allows ISPs to advertise a single summarized route for multiple networks.

---

### Example

- Combine: 192.168.0.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24
- Supernet: 192.168.0.0/23 (covers 192.168.0.0‚Äì192.168.1.255)
