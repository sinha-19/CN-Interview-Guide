## What are Wireless & Mobile Networks?

**Wireless Networks** use electromagnetic waves (radio, infrared, etc.) for communication instead of cables.  
**Mobile Networks** allow users to move freely while maintaining network connectivity.

## Cellular Mobile Networks

### Generations

- **1G:** Analog voice communication
- **2G:** Digital voice (GSM, CDMA)
- **3G:** Faster data, video calls, internet (UMTS)
- **4G:** High-speed internet, HD video (LTE)
- **5G:** Ultra-fast, low latency, IoT support

### Key Components

- **Mobile Station (MS):** User‚Äôs device (phone, tablet)
- **Base Station (BS):** Antenna/Tower connecting MS to the network
- **Mobile Switching Center (MSC):** Manages calls and mobility
- **SIM Card:** Stores user identity and authentication info

## Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)

- Most common WLAN standard.
- Operates on 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.
- Supports various security protocols (WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3).

---

## Bluetooth

- Short-range communication (up to 10 meters).
- Used for connecting peripherals (headphones, keyboards, etc.).

---

## Mobile IP & Roaming

- **Mobile IP:** Allows devices to move between networks while maintaining a permanent IP address.
- **Roaming:** Enables mobile devices to connect to other networks outside their home network.

---

## Security Concerns

- Eavesdropping/interception of wireless signals.
- Unauthorized access to wireless networks.
- Use of strong encryption (WPA2/WPA3) and secure authentication is critical.

## Advantages & Disadvantages

| Advantages                   | Disadvantages                |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Mobility & flexibility       | Interference & signal loss   |
| Easy installation            | Lower data rates than wired  |
| Supports multiple devices    | Security vulnerabilities     |
