# 04. Data Link Layer & Protocols

---

## What is the Data Link Layer?

The **Data Link Layer** is the second layer in the OSI model. It is responsible for reliable transmission of data frames between two devices on the same network segment.

---

## Main Functions of the Data Link Layer

- **Framing:** Divides data received from the Network Layer into manageable units called frames.
- **Physical Addressing:** Adds MAC (Media Access Control) addresses to frames, identifying source and destination devices on the network.
- **Error Detection & Correction:** Detects and may correct errors that occur during transmission using techniques like CRC, parity bits, etc.
- **Flow Control:** Prevents overwhelming the receiver by controlling the rate of data transmission.
- **Access Control:** Determines which device has control over the communication channel at any given time (important in shared-media networks).

## Sublayers of the Data Link Layer

1. **Logical Link Control (LLC):**
   - Manages communication between the Network Layer and the MAC sublayer.
   - Provides error and flow control.

2. **Media Access Control (MAC):**
   - Controls how devices gain access to the medium and permission to transmit data.
   - Handles MAC addresses.

## Data Link Layer Protocols

| Protocol       | Usage                         |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| Ethernet       | LAN, wired networks           |
| Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) | Wireless LANs           |
| PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) | Direct links  |
| HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control) | WAN links|
| Frame Relay    | WAN, packet switching         |
| Token Ring     | LAN (legacy)                  |

---

## Error Detection Techniques

- **Parity Bit**
- **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**
- **Checksum**

---

## MAC Address

- 48-bit hardware address unique to each network interface card (NIC).
- Written in hexadecimal, e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.
