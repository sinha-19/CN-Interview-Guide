# 09. Network Security & Firewalls

---

## What is Network Security?

**Network Security** refers to the policies, practices, and technologies used to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of computer networks and data.

---

## Security Goals

- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring data is accessed only by authorized parties.
- **Integrity:** Protecting data from being altered or tampered with.
- **Availability:** Ensuring network services are accessible when needed.
- **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of users and devices.
- **Non-repudiation:** Ensuring that the sender cannot deny sending a message.

---

## Types of Threats

- **Malware:** Viruses, worms, trojans.
- **Phishing:** Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overloading systems to make them unavailable.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Intercepting communications between parties.
- **Eavesdropping:** Unauthorized interception of network traffic.
- **Spoofing:** Impersonating another device or user.

---

## Common Security Measures

- **Encryption:** Converting data into a coded format (e.g., SSL/TLS, IPsec).
- **Authentication:** Passwords, biometrics, multi-factor authentication.
- **Access Control:** Firewalls, ACLs, user permissions.
- **Antivirus/Antimalware Software:** Detects and removes malicious software.
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Monitors and blocks suspicious activities.
- **Security Policies:** Formal rules and procedures for network use.

## What is a Firewall?

A **firewall** is a security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

### Types of Firewalls

| Type                | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Packet Filtering    | Inspects packets and filters based on rules (IP, port, protocol). |
| Stateful Inspection | Keeps track of active connections and makes decisions based on the state of traffic. |
| Proxy Firewall      | Intermediary between users and the internet, filters application-level data. |
| Next-Gen Firewall   | Integrates traditional firewall with advanced features (IDS/IPS, deep packet inspection, etc.). |

---

## How Firewalls Work

- Analyze network traffic based on rules.
- Allow or block packets based on source/destination IP, port, or protocol.
- Can be hardware, software, or cloud-based.

---

## Network Security Best Practices

- Use strong passwords and change them regularly.
- Keep software and firmware up to date.
- Regularly back up important data.
- Educate users about security threats and safe practices.
- Use VPNs for secure remote access.
