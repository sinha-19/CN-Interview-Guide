# 05. Network Layer & IP Addressing

---

## What is the Network Layer?

The **Network Layer** is the third layer in the OSI model. Its main responsibility is to move packets from the source to the destination ‚Äî possibly across multiple networks (routing).

---

## Main Functions of the Network Layer

- **Logical Addressing:** Assigns and manages IP addresses so devices can be uniquely identified across networks.
- **Routing:** Determines the best path for data to travel from source to destination.
- **Packet Forwarding:** Moves data packets towards their destination using routers.
- **Fragmentation & Reassembly:** Breaks large packets into smaller ones to match the network‚Äôs maximum transmission unit (MTU), and reassembles them at the destination.
- **Error Handling & Diagnostics:** Uses protocols like ICMP for reporting errors and diagnostics.

---

## Key Devices at the Network Layer

- **Routers:** Make forwarding decisions based on IP addresses.
- **Layer 3 Switches:** Operate at the network layer for fast routing within LANs.

## Important Protocols

| Protocol | Description               |
|----------|---------------------------|
| IP       | Internet Protocol, core protocol for logical addressing and routing |
| ICMP     | Internet Control Message Protocol, error reporting & diagnostics   |
| ARP      | Address Resolution Protocol, maps IP addresses to MAC addresses    |
| IGMP     | Internet Group Management Protocol, manages multicast groups       |

## IP Addressing

### What is an IP Address?

- A unique logical address assigned to each device on a network.
- **IPv4:** 32 bits, written as four decimal numbers (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6:** 128 bits, written as eight hexadecimal blocks (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

### Classes of IPv4 Addresses

| Class | Range         | Default Mask      | Purpose                    |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| A     | 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255 | 255.0.0.0 | Large networks           |
| B     | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 | 255.255.0.0 | Medium networks         |
| C     | 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 | 255.255.255.0 | Small networks         |
| D     | 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 | N/A | Multicasting              |
| E     | 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 | N/A | Research/Experimental     |

### Private vs Public IP Addresses

- **Private:** Used within local networks (e.g., 192.168.x.x)
- **Public:** Routable on the internet, assigned by ISPs

---

## Subnetting

- Divides a larger network into smaller, manageable segments (subnets).
- Helps in efficient IP address management and improves security.

---

## Routing

- **Static Routing:** Manually configured routes, suitable for small networks.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Routing tables updated automatically using protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF, BGP).
